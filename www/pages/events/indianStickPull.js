	"description": "Using a greased stick about a foot long and tapered at both ends, athletes attempt to pull the stick away from each other. No body contact is allowed and feet must remain in place on the floor. The athlete who pulls the dowel from the other's hand, or pulls it past their opponent's hip for ten seconds, wins the round.  The winner of two rounds takes the match.",
