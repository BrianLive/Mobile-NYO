	"name": "One Hand Reach",
	"description": "This game requires the athlete to balance on their hands with at least one elbow tucked under the lower abdominal area. The rest of the body is parallel to the floor. The athlete then uses one hand to reach up and touch the suspended target. Upon doing this, they must get the same hand back to the floor before any other part of their body touches the floor. When three athletes remain in the competition, the ball is raised in 1-inch increments until there is a winner.",
