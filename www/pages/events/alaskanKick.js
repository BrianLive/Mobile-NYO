	"name": "Alaskan High Kick",
	"description": "The athlete sits on the floor and balances on one foot while reaching across the torso to hold the other foot. Leaning back on the opposite hand, the athlete thrusts the balancing foot straight up to kick a suspended ball, and then lands on the kicking-foot without losing balance. The ball is raised in 4-inch increments after each round, with athletes allowed three attempts at each height. When three athletes are left to compete, the ball is raised in 1-inch increments until there is a winner.",
