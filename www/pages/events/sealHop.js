	"description": "The object is to see how far an athlete can go in a push-up position, with elbows bent and knuckles down. The only parts of the body allowed to touch the floor are knuckles and toes. From this position, the participant hops forward as far as possible while keeping the back straight and elbows bent. Female athletes assume a push-up position with arms straight and palms flat on the floor. Athletes who travel the greatest distance, win.",
