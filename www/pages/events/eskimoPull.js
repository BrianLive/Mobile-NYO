	"name": "Eskimo Stick Pull",
	"description": "Two athletes sit on the floor facing each other with the soles of their feet touching. Feet must be parallel and together, with knees bent at a 45-degree angle. With palms facing the floor, contestants grasp a stick placed between them, and try to pull the stick away from their opponent without jerking or re-setting their grip. Contestants win when their opponent is pulled off the floor, falls over sideways or releases their grip. Hand positions are alternated between rounds, with the winner of two rounds taking the match.",
